Encryption is the process that transforms the text or information to the unrecognizable form and decryption is the process to convert the encrypted message into original form.


Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.
